            <h4>Ingredients</h4>
            
            <ul>
                <li>3 Cups Standard Flour</li>
                <li>6 tsp Baking Powder </li>
                <li>1/4 tsp salt</li>
                <li>75g butter</li>
                <li>1-1.5 cups of full fat cows milk</li>

            </ul>

            <h4>Method</h4>

            <ol>
                <li>Preheat the oven to 220ÂºC. Grease or flour a baking tray.</li>
                <li>Sift the flour, baking powder and salt into a bowl. Rub in the butter with your fingertips until the mixture resembles fine breadcrumbs.</li>
                <li>Add the milk and quickly mix with a round-bladed table knife to a soft dough. For light and tender scones the mixture should be quite soft and a little sticky. Scrape the dough onto the floured baking tray and flour the top.</li>
                <li>Working quickly, pat the dough out to 2cm thickness and with a floured knife cut it into 12 even-sized pieces, then separate the scones to allow 2cm space between them. Brush the tops with milk.</li>
                <li>Bake for 10 minutes or until golden brown. Place on a wire rack to cool, wrapped in a clean tea towel to keep them soft. </li>
            </ol>
        </div>
